IFrameOrchestrator
==================

Orchestrates messages between and IFrame and it's parent page and also between IFrames on the same page.

I know that this looks like a bit outdated as a functionality, after all, who uses IFrames anyway!?

Well, if you're asking yourself this question is because you're not a SharePoint developer.
In SharePoint, Provider Hosted Apps are rendered inside IFrames, and sometimes you'll end up with a mess of a dashboard page.

With this tool you'll be able to establish a communication pipeline between each IFrame and it's parent easing a lot of pain.

To take this a bit further, you'll also be able to pass messages (strings of JSON objects) between IFrames.

So the motivation behind this tool was for SharePoint complex apps but there's no dependency whatsoever to SharePoint.

Enjoy!
